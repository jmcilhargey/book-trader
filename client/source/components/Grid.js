Basic programming concepts - assuming no prior knowledge of programming beyond an ability to create a web page using HTML & CSS ; 2. Core elements of the JavaScript language - so you can learn how to write your own scripts from scratch ; 3. jQuery - which will allow you to simplify the process of writing scripts (this is introduced half-way through the book once you have a solid understanding of JavaScript) ; 4. How to recreate techniques you will have seen on other web sites such as sliders, content filters, form validation, updating content using Ajax, and more. Each chapter: Breaks subjects down into bite-sized chunks with a new topic on each page ; Contains clear descriptions of syntax, each one demonstrated with inspiring code samples ; Uses diagrams and photography to explain complex concepts in a visual way. This book enables you to use & customize thousands of scripts, JavaScript APIs, and jQuery plugins that are freely available on the web as well as create your own scripts from scratch.","isbn":"9781118871652","pages":640,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_uTRAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"title":"JavaScript: The Good Parts","authors":"Douglas Crockford","description":"Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables. When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including: Syntax Objects Functions Inheritance Arrays Regular expressions Methods Style Beautiful features The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to unlearn all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book. With JavaScript: The Good Parts, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.","isbn":"9780596554873","pages":172,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PXa2bby0oQ0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"title":"Eloquent JavaScript","authors":"Marijn Haverbeke","description":"Provides information and examples on writing JavaScript code, covering such topics as syntax, control, data, regular expressions, and scripting.","isbn":"9781593272821","pages":224,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=9U5I_tskq9MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"title":"JavaScript: The Definitive Guide","authors":"David Flanagan","description":"This Fifth Edition is completely revised and expanded to cover JavaScript as it is used in today's Web 2.0 applications. This book is both an example-driven programmer's guide and a keep-on-your-desk reference, with new chapters that explain everything you need to know to get the most out of JavaScript, including: Scripted HTTP and Ajax XML processing Client-side graphics using the canvas tag Namespaces in JavaScript--essential when writing complex programs Classes, closures, persistence, Flash, and JavaScript embedded in Java applications Part I explains the core JavaScript language in detail. If you are new to JavaScript, it will teach you the language. If you are already a JavaScript programmer, Part I will sharpen your skills and deepen your understanding of the language. Part II explains the scripting environment provided by web browsers, with a focus on DOM scripting with unobtrusive JavaScript. The broad and deep coverage of client-side JavaScript is illustrated with many sophisticated examples that demonstrate how to: Generate a table of contents for an HTML document Display DHTML animations Automate form validation Draw dynamic pie charts Make HTML elements draggable Define keyboard shortcuts for web applications Create Ajax-enabled tool tips Use XPath and XSLT on XML documents loaded with Ajax And much more Part III is a complete reference for core JavaScript. It documents every class, object, constructor, method, function, property, and constant defined by JavaScript 1.5 and ECMAScript Version 3. Part IV is a reference for client-side JavaScript, covering legacy web browser APIs, the standard Level 2 DOM API, and emerging standards such as the XMLHttpRequest object and the canvas tag.

This book helps you answer that question with numerous JavaScript coding patterns and best practices. If you're an experienced developer looking to solve problems related to objects, functions, inheritance, and other language-specific categories, the abstractions and code templates in this guide are ideal—whether you're using JavaScript to write a client-side, server-side, or desktop application. Written by JavaScript expert Stoyan Stefanov—Senior Yahoo! Technical and architect of YSlow 2.0, the web page performance optimization tool—JavaScript Patterns includes practical advice for implementing each pattern discussed, along with several hands-on examples. You'll also learn about anti-patterns: common programming approaches that cause more problems than they solve. Explore useful habits for writing high-quality JavaScript code, such as avoiding globals, using single var declarations, and more Learn why literal notation patterns are simpler alternatives to constructor functions Discover different ways to define a function in JavaScript Create objects that go beyond the basic patterns of using object literals and constructor functions Learn the options available for code reuse and inheritance in JavaScript Study sample JavaScript approaches to common design patterns such as Singleton, Factory, Decorator, and more Examine patterns that apply specifically to the client-side browser environment","isbn":"9781449396947","pages":236,"image":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WTZqecc9olUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=2&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},{"title":"JavaScript","authors":"David Flanagan","description":"A revised and updated edition offers comprehensive coverage of ECMAScript 5 (the new JavaScript language standard) and also the new APIs introduced in HTML5, with chapters on functions and classes completely rewritten and updated to match current best practices and a new chapter on language extensions and subsets.
